## About

The **Intel 8085** is an 8-bit microprocessor widely used in early computing systems. This repository contains assembly language programs written for the 8085 microprocessor, covering basic arithmetic operations, conditional jumps, loops, and memory manipulation.

These programs were developed as part of the **Microprocessor Lab** curriculum at **Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT)**.

## Programs

Here is a list of programs included in this repository:

1. **Addition of Two Numbers**  
   - Adds two 8-bit numbers and stores the result in memory.

2. **Subtraction of Two Numbers**  
   - Subtracts two 8-bit numbers and handles negative results using 2's complement.

3. **Multiplication Using Repeated Addition**  
   - Multiplies two 8-bit numbers using repeated addition and handles carry.

4. **Division Using Repeated Subtraction**  
   - Divides two 8-bit numbers using repeated subtraction and stores the quotient and remainder.

5. **Conditional Jumps (JNC, JC)**  
   - Demonstrates the use of conditional jump instructions like `JNC` and `JC`.

6. **Memory Manipulation**  
   - Programs that load, store, and manipulate data in memory.
