## About

The **Intel 8085** is an 8-bit microprocessor widely used in early computing systems. This repository contains assembly language programs written for the 8085 microprocessor, covering basic arithmetic operations, conditional jumps, loops, and memory manipulation.

These programs were developed as part of the **Microprocessor Lab** curriculum at **Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT)**.

## Programs

Here is a list of programs included in this repository:

1. **Addition of Two Numbers** (`addition.asm`)  
   - Adds two 8-bit numbers and stores the result in memory.

2. **Subtraction of Two Numbers** (`subtraction.asm`)  
   - Subtracts two 8-bit numbers and handles negative results using 2's complement.

3. **Multiplication Using Repeated Addition** (`multiplication.asm`)  
   - Multiplies two 8-bit numbers using repeated addition and handles carry.

4. **Division Using Repeated Subtraction** (`division.asm`)  
   - Divides two 8-bit numbers using repeated subtraction and stores the quotient and remainder.

5. **Conditional Jumps (JNC, JC)**  
   - Demonstrates the use of conditional jump instructions like `JNC` and `JC`.

6. **Memory Manipulation**  
   - Programs that load, store, and manipulate data in memory.

7. **Find Prime Numbers in an Array**  
   - Finds prime numbers in an array and stores them in another memory location.

8. **ASCII to Hexadecimal Conversion** (`asciiToHexadec.asm`)  
   - Converts ASCII values to their hexadecimal equivalents.

9. **BCD to Hexadecimal Conversion** (`bcdToHex.asm`)  
   - Converts BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) values to hexadecimal.

10. **Decimal Up Counter** (`decimalUpCounter.asm`)  
    - Implements a decimal up counter using BCD arithmetic.

11. **Hexadecimal Down Counter** (`hexDowncounter.asm`)  
    - Implements a hexadecimal down counter.

12. **Hexadecimal to ASCII Conversion** (`hexToAscii.asm`)  
    - Converts hexadecimal values to their ASCII equivalents.

13. **Hexadecimal to BCD Conversion** (`hexToBcd.asm`)  
    - Converts hexadecimal values to BCD.

14. **Sorting an Array** (`sorting.asm`)  
    - Sorts an array of numbers in ascending or descending order.
